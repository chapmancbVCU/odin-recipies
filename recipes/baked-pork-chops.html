    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups panko</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons grated Parmesan</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Four 3/4-inch bon-in pork chops (about 2 1/4 pounds)</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges, for serving, optional</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Combine the panko, oil, Parmesan, Italian seasoning and 3/4 teaspoon 
            each salt and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Put the pork 
            chops in a large bowl and toss to coat with 1 tablespoon water. Place 
            the pork chops in the bag and shake well to coat, pressing the 
            breadcrumb mixture firmly into the meat.
        </li>
        <li>Place the pork chops on a wire rack set on a baking sheet and top 
            evenly with any breadcrumbs remaining in the bag. Bake until the 
            breadcrumbs are dark golden and the internal temperature of the 
            chops registers 145 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer 
            (avoid touching bone), 15 to 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Serve immediately with lemon wedges if using.</li>
    </ol>
